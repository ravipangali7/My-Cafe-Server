# Example nginx location block for serving /media/ with CORS headers.
# Use this when nginx (or your reverse proxy) serves media files directly
# so the frontend (e.g. https://mycafe.sewabyapar.com) can load images cross-origin.
#
# Add this location inside your server { } block for mycafeserver.sewabyapar.com,
# then reload nginx: sudo nginx -s reload (or your server's reload command).
#
# Replace /path/to/your/project/media with the actual MEDIA_ROOT path on the server.

location /media/ {
    alias /path/to/your/project/media/;
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://mycafe.sewabyapar.com";
}

# If you have multiple allowed frontend origins, you can use the request origin
# (requires nginx map or similar). For a single frontend, the line above is enough.
